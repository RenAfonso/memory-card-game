# How to contribute

Even though this is a Udacity project for my Nanodegree, I plan on allowing my children to play this web app. Adding the two features in the [README.md](README.md) is what I'm looking for.

I'll also accept any group of 8 images suitable for children (Paw Patrol, Mickey and Friends, etc.) already sized for this app - 125px per card.

If you want to contribute, and all help is appreciated, please contact me before the pull request. Also, please don't use any colors besides the ones already in the `app.css` file.
